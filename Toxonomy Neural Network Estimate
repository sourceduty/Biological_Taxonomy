This Neural Network Estimate outlines the architecture and neuron requirements for a model designed to tackle complex taxonomy database problems, such as variant citations, homonyms, synonyms, changes in taxon names over time, and data integration challenges. This estimates the number of neurons needed for each layer, ranging from 100-300 neurons per token in the input layer to 512-2048 neurons per layer in the more complex encoding layers, such as RNNs or Transformers. The total number of neurons is projected to vary based on the scale of the model, with small-scale models requiring between 10,000 to 50,000 neurons, and large-scale models potentially needing between 100,000 to 500,000 neurons or more.

This estimate emphasizes the importance of parameter tuning and cross-validation to fine-tune the model's architecture, ensuring that it meets the specific needs of the taxonomy tasks without overfitting. Additionally, it recommends a scalable model design that can be expanded as necessary, depending on performance results during development. By carefully estimating neuron requirements and adopting a flexible approach, the neural network aims to provide robust solutions for standardizing taxonomic data, resolving ambiguities, and improving data integrity across various databases.
